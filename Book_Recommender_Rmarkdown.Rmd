<h1>Getting the libraries for this Project</h1>



```{r}

<h1>Reading the dataset</h1>
<h2>Converting all blank columns to NA</h2>

```{r}
Book_details <- read.csv(file = 'Merged_books_summary.csv')
Books_details1 <- Book_details %>% mutate_all(na_if,NA)
Books_details1 <- Book_details %>% mutate_all(na_if,"")
User_Review<-read.csv(file = 'Merged_books_users_rating.csv')
```
<h4> I will use the Books_details1 for data analysis and user_review to build the recommender system<h4> 
<h2>Number of books published each year </h2>
<h4>Number of books published between 1900-2017 </h4>
```{r}

g <- ggplot(data = Book_details, aes(x=publication_year))
zoom <- coord_cartesian(xlim = c(1900,2017))
g+geom_histogram(binwidth = 10)+zoom
```



The maximum books are published between 2000 and 2017
I will see the microscopic details between these years and limit the dataset for after 2000
<h4>Number of books published between 1900-2017 </h4>
```{r}
g <- ggplot(data = Book_details, aes(x=publication_year))
g+geom_histogram(binwidth = 1,fill='blue',color = 'black')+scale_x_continuous(breaks = seq(from = 2000, to = 2017, by = 1))+coord_cartesian(xlim = c(2000,2017))
```

<h4>2013 has the maximum number of books published from my dataset</h4>

I will filter the data from 2000-2017 for my analysis

```{r}
Books_21st_century <-subset(Books_details1, publication_year >=2000  & publication_year <= 2017)
```

I have 93659 books from 21st century

<h2>How does number of pages affect popularity(number of pages vrs rating/number of rating)</h2>

<h4>Spread of number of pages in 21st century</h4>
```{r}
ggplot(data = Books_21st_century, aes(x="", y=num_pages, na.rm=TRUE)) +geom_boxplot()+coord_cartesian(ylim = c(0, 5000))+xlab("Spread of Number of Pages")
summary(Books_21st_century$num_pages)
```

The page numbers range from 0-945077 with mean 274.6 and median 250 pages


```{r}
Books_21st_century %>%filter (num_pages == 0) %>%group_by (title)
```

Some books have 0 pages which is a misrepresantation


<h2>Does number of pages effect popularity (Ratings and number of ratings)</h2>

```{r}

grid.arrange(plot1, plot2, ncol=2)
```

<h4>Books with more than 1000 pages are highly rated with very few outliers</h4>


```{r}

<h4>Popularity(number of ratings) of books is less as the number of pages are more than 1000. Most popular books were between 200-500 pages </h4>

<h2>How does number of authors affect popularity(number of pages vrs rating/number of rating)</h2>

```{r}
ggplot(data = Books_21st_century, aes(x="", y=num_authors, na.rm=TRUE)) +geom_boxplot()+ggtitle("Spread of number of authors")

```

There are many outliers. I will look at the books with more than 2 authors

```{r}
auth_2<-Books_21st_century %>%filter(num_authors>2) %>%select(num_authors)
summary(auth_2)

```

The dataset has books upto 51 authors

```{r}
plot5<-ggplot(data = Books_21st_century, aes(x=num_authors, y=average_rating,na.rm=TRUE)) +geom_point()+coord_cartesian(xlim = c(0, 51))+xlab("number of authors")+ylab("Average Rating")+ggtitle("Effect of number of Authors on average Rating")

grid.arrange(plot5, plot6, ncol=2)
```

<h4>From the plot, books with more number of authors are not rated low ,books with less number(<10) of authors does not have any correlation with rating, however less people purchased books with many number of authors</h4>


<h2>Top 10 maximum book version</h2>
```{r}

<h4>English is the most popular language followed by Spanish, Arabic and French</h4>

<h2>How did popularity of ebooks change between 2000-2017(number of ebooks every year)</h2>

Paperback is the most available books, followed by hardcover and ebook, there are still very less number of audiobooks

kindle edition is more popular than all other types of ebooks, kindle has brought a lot of change in reading behavior

<h1>RECOMMENDER SYSTEM MODEL</h1>
<h4>I will model a collaborative User-based recommendation system
The model will look at similarity between users and then find n users closest to the person we want to recommend and search for product those people have bought
one has purchased,other will be recommended
I will use the user_review dataset to build this recommender system</h4>

<h2>Looking at the distribution of Ratings</h2>
```{r}

<h4>75% of user has given 6 recommendation or less

<h4>There are lot of NA in the matrix which is called sparsity.
